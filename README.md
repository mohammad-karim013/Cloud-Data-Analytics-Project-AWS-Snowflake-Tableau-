**📌 Project Workflow**

**1. Data Ingestion (AWS S3)**

Collected raw data files and stored them securely in an Amazon S3 bucket.

Ensured proper folder structure for efficient data organization and retrieval.

Here's the URL of AWS(S3)
https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/tableau.project03?region=us-east-1&tab=objects&bucketType=general

---

**2. Access & Integration Setup (Snowflake + AWS)**

Created required roles and permissions in Snowflake.

Configured an integration object to establish a secure connection with AWS S3.

Updated trust policies to allow Snowflake to access the S3 bucket seamlessly.

---

**3. Data Loading (Snowflake)**

Loaded data from S3 into Snowflake tables.

Verified schema consistency, applied data validation checks, and optimized storage.

---

**4. Data Exploration & Transformation**

Performed data profiling to understand structure, patterns, and anomalies.

Applied Snowflake SQL transformations for:

Data cleaning (handling nulls, formatting issues)

Aggregations (monthly usage, cost analysis)

---

**5. Data Visualization (Tableau)**

Connected Snowflake directly to Tableau for real-time query execution.

Designed charts and reports to highlight:

📊 Monthly usage consumption trends

💰 Cost savings and optimization opportunities
